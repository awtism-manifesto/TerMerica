[h1]Welcome to TerMerica![/h1]

TerMerica is the perfect mod for those of us who want just that extra little bit of American freedom in our terraria playthroughs. And by American freedom, i mean tons of guns, explosives, and virtually any other type of weapon of war you can think of!

This is [b] one of the largest weapons expansion mods on 1.4 TModLoader, adding over 250 total weapons, and almost 450 total items. 

I am still learning and improving at modding terraria, so expect major revamps and updates in the future!

Some features of this mod are admittedly quite crude and unserious, but everything should be balanced, especially when played with other content mods.

[b] Speaking of other content mods, TerMerica should be compatible with **almost** any mod and has built-in compatibility with many mods, including but not limited to:
Calamity Mod
Thorium Mod
Secrets of the Shadows
Macrocosm
Spooky Mod
and more!! [/b]
**The only mod i've found that causes issues with TerMerica is Colored Damage Types. I have no idea why it breaks stuff. If there are any other incompatibilities or weird interactions please report them in the Discord(Linked below).

[h3]TerMerica adds two new damage classes: Stupid and Omni. Stupid is a meme class, and Omni damage weapons are boosted by all class-specific bonuses

Lots of TerMerica's gear is designed with multiclassing in mind. Don't feel pressured to stick to just one class!

TerMerica has 2 new Town NPCs, the Politician and Dumbass (Hints for unlocking: politicians are attracted to pure evil, and the Dumbass won't stop babbling about crabs for some reason...)

Due to the American military-industrial complex, many vanilla weapons have been buffed and/or reworked to meet rigorous military standards.

TerMerica also makes Rocket Launchers, Flamethrowers, and Dartguns more developed subclasses, with full game progression for all three subclasses.[/h3]

Additionally, TerMerica makes the enemies in your world richer, like the actual United States. (many enemies drop new/extra items!)

TerMerica is currently best enjoyed with other larger content mods like the ones mentioned above, as it is currently a smaller content mod.

Feel free to leave a comment or join our discord https://discord.gg/t8pQ48eqsm for balance suggestions,item ideas bug reports, or to join the TerMerica team.

I would recommend using Recipe Browser to figure out TerMerica's many recipes.

TerMerica has very little world generation and doesn't rework major game mechanics, so it is even able to be added to heavily modded playthroughs/playthroughs already in progress with no issues.

If you are a mod developer, I both allow and actively encourage you to create DLC's, Addons, or localizations of TerMerica. I would also reccomend joining the discord if you are going to do this (link above)

Special thanks to River, Sprunolia, Yelmut, Hannibal, Pil, and the Pixel Gun 3D Wiki for sprite art!!!
